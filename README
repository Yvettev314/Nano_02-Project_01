### Description
Project 1 - Write a blog on any platform of our choice (chosen platform is Medium), using the CRISP-DM methodology to evaluate data from Airbnb on activity in Boston, Ma, USA.

### Showing the project follows the CRISP-DM Process:
STEP 1 - Business Understanding
Brief description
Whether you are new to the game and want to list your first home on Airbnb, or you want to re-evaluate the value of your current listing, determining how much money 
your listing is worth shouldn’t be a guessing game. Knowing how to evaluate your market and developing a pricing strategy can maximize your rental income. In this post, 
I will describe how the CRISP-DM methodology was followed to predict the value drivers for homes on Airbnb - The data used is from Kaggle’s survey data for Airbnb activity 
in Boston, MA, USA in 2016. There are a lot of insights you can obtain from this data, however, the particular questions motivating this post are:

Question 1 - Can we determine the value drivers for the price of a home on Airbnb, as well as predict the value of a listing?
Question 2 - What general observations can we make from the data that would aid clients/users of Airbnb in decision making, ex: Which
location is the most/least expensive to rent from for a one bedroom home, and what property type (house/loft/guesthouse etc.) is most/least
popular?
Question 3 - How does the price of a listing change based on property type, the number of bedrooms offered/bathrooms offered?

STEP 2 - Data Understanding
Access and Explore
The data contains 3353 entries from 25 different neighborhoods in Boston, MA - Each entry being a unique listing. The location (market, neighborhood),
price (daily rate, cleaning fee, security deposit), availability (nights available per month / year) and quality (reviews, amenities) was provided in the
survey data. Not all listings are complete, in other words, there are some listings that miss some of the information above, ex. missing the cleaning fee
or listing description, etc.

STEP 3 - Prepare Data
Wrangle and Clean
I will briefly talk through some of the data preparation steps. Some listings were incomplete - i.e., they had missing values for
certain properties such as the cleaning fee, security deposit, guests allowed etc. The missing data for these listings were replaced with 0 as one of our
assumptions. For properties such as the number of beds or bedrooms provided, some listings had listed zero, which doesn’t make sense. In this situation the
listing was removed from the dataset and excluded from the analysis. Completely empty columns, and columns containing no unique values were also removed from
the dataset. Z-score was used to detect outliers, and these values were also removed from the dataset. The dataset was split into numerical and categorical
datasets. When developing the model to predict the price of a listing, both categorical and numerical data was included. A model was developed to predict the
price of a listing based on several properties that make a listing unique — The location (specific neighborhood), how many guests are accommodated, number of
bathrooms, number of bedrooms, number of beds, the availability and the overall review score for the listing. The data was split into training, test, and
validation sets, and the model was fit using the data prepared. The model was evaluated by looking at the following metrics: r2-score, mean squared error,
root mean squared error, and the feature importance. Having a better understanding of the data, what questions we want to answer with it, and how we went
about the process, we can take a look at the results next.

STEP 4 - Modeling
Question 1 --- A model was developed to predict the price of a listing based on several properties that make a listing unique —The location, how many guests
are accommodated, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, number of beds, availability and quality. The model was evaluated by looking at the following
metrics: r2-score, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and the feature importance. The r2-score was 58%, mean squared error was 4283, and the root
mean squared error was 65. To obtain some indication of which properties are value drivers, we can look at the feature importance. The properties that seemed
to play the biggest role was the number of guests the home could accommodate, followed by the number of bathrooms offered. The variables with the lowest
importance was the availability of the listing and the review score — These variables seemed to be insignificant. When the availability of the listing and
the review score was removed from the model, the r2 value was similar to that of the first model. These variables were excluded from the second revision of
the model. The model was fit again. We looked at the feature importance, and again the number of guests the home could accommodate was the most important
feature, and the number of beds provided seemed to be insignificant when predicting the price of the home. ‘The number of beds’ were removed and the model
was refitted. The performance of the model was similar as well as the r2 value. Running the feature importance again, we see that all remaining variables
play a significant role — Remaining variables: Number of guests accommodated, number of bathrooms offered, number of bedrooms offered, and the location of
the home.

STEP 5 - Evaluation
Question 2 --- This is only for a one bedroom home with varying amenities provided and property types. The difference between the highest priced listing
(~$211 per night in Back Bay) and the lowest priced listing (~$60 per night in Hyde Park) is ~$151 for a one bedroom. Looking at the amenities for an
average one bedroom home in these two areas didn’t really indicate that this is a value driver as they both provided similar amenities. We can also
look at the average price for a home based on the property type -- This is for a one bedroom home with varying amenities provided and it isn’t exclusive
to any neighborhood. The difference between the highest priced property type (~$250 per night for a Boat) and the lowest priced property type (~$60 per
night for a dorm room) is ~$190 for a one bedroom. Amenities are similar between the different listings.

Question 3 --- The price of one listing compared to another will always be different depending on location, how much guests the home accommodates, amenities
provided, and how many beds/bathrooms are offered. But what was interesting from the data was seeing how much extra it will cost you for every additional
bedroom added from a one bedroom (this also changed for beds/bathrooms etc.).Not based on any particular neighborhood, and looking at all the listings in
Boston combined, the average price per listing for a one bedroom home is ~$140. For an additional bedroom (2-bedroom), that will cost you an extra ~$120
(Total ~$260). We can keep going, a 3rd bedroom will be ~$58 extra (Total ~$318), a 4th bedroom is an additional ~$73 (Total ~$391), and a 5th bedroom will
cost you an additional ~$40, upgrading from a 4 to a 5 bedroom home (Total ~$431). We assume that this price increase per additional bedroom is the same no
matter the location of the rental. However, this is not true because price per square foot can vary based on several factors making one home different from
the next — ex: location, the age of the property, condition of the property, nearby amenities and upgrades to the property all contribute to the price of the
lot per square foot. For the sake of this analysis, we will assume it is the same. We can do the same analysis for the number of bathrooms offered - However,
this was analyzed for a 3 bedroom home. The average price for a listing for a 3-bedroom home with one bathroom is ~$240. For and additional bathroom
(2-bathrooms), that will cost you an extra ~$91 (Total ~$331). For a 3-bedroom and 3-bathroom home, you will pay ~$492. That’s an extra ~$161.

### Credits
I've used a lot of sites such as Stack Overflow to aid in writing
the code.

### Conclusion
The model needs refinement, which is something that can be investigated in a next phase — Because of this, the model can at best be used to provide an
indication of the value of a listing, and the user shouldn’t use the valuation predicted by the model in isolation, but in consideration with additional
market research. The user should use their own discretion when determining the value of the property they are listing.
