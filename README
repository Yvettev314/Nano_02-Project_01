Anglo American Data Scientist: Write a Data Science Blog Post
Link: https://medium.com/@yvettev314/predict-the-value-drivers-of-homes-on-airbnb-b284161aabd9

### Description
Project 1 - We are to write a blog on any platform of our choice
(chosen platform is Medium), using the CRISP-DM methodology to
evaluate data from Airbnb on activity in Boston, Ma, USA.

### Files used
Nano02_Project01.py - This is the python code used to evaluate the data
README.md - This is a description of the project
listings.csv - This is the source data used for the project

### Credits
I've used a lot of sites such as Stack Overflow to aid in writing
the code.

### Motivation
The motivation for this project was to use the CRISP-DM method
to answer the following questions about the Airbnb Data:
1 - Can we determine the value drivers for the price of a home on
Airbnb, as well as predict the value of a listing?

2 - What general observations can we make from the data that would
aid clients/users of Airbnb in decision making, ex: Which location
is the most/least expensive to rent from for a one bedroom home, and
what property type (house/loft/guesthouse etc.) is most/least popular?

3 - How does the price of a listing change based on property type,
the number of bedrooms offered/bathrooms offered?

### Summary of the results
The r2-score was 58%, mean squared error was 4283, and the root
mean squared error was 65. The model needs refinement, which is
something that can be investigated in a next phase — Because of
this, the model can at best be used to provide an indication of
the value of a listing, and the user shouldn’t use the valuation
predicted by the model in isolation, but in consideration with
additional market research. The user should use their own
discretion when determining the value of the property they are listing.
